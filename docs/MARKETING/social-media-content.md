```
The Future of Open-Source Contribution is Here

After years of developers contributing to open-source projects without compensation, we're changing the game.

Introducing Roxonn Platform – a decentralized system that automatically rewards GitHub contributors with cryptocurrency the moment their pull requests are merged.

How It Works:

For Project Maintainers:
Fund your repository with XDC, ROXN tokens, or USDC. Set bounties, attract talent, and only pay when quality work is delivered.

For Developers:
Contribute to repositories you're passionate about and earn real compensation. Your reward arrives in your wallet automatically when your PR is merged.

Why This Matters:

The open-source ecosystem has a sustainability problem. Brilliant developers invest thousands of hours into projects that power the internet, often without compensation.

Roxonn solves this with blockchain technology:
✅ Trustless payment distribution via smart contracts
✅ XDC blockchain integration (low fees, high speed)
✅ Support for both public and private repositories
✅ Multi-currency flexibility (XDC, ROXN, USDC)
