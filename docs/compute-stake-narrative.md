# Roxonn: Own the Engine of AI.

## 1. The Problem: AI is a Walled Garden

The future of technology is being built with artificial intelligence, but its power is concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations. Access to powerful AI models requires massive, centralized data centers, making it expensive, exclusive, and controlled. This centralization stifles innovation and creates a digital divide, leaving most developers and users on the outside looking in.

## 2. The Solution: A Community-Powered AI Engine

Roxonn is breaking down these walls. We are building a decentralized AI ecosystem where everyone can participate, contribute, and own a piece of the future. Our platform is built on three integrated layers:

-   **The ROXN Layer (The Fuel):** The `ROXN` token is the economic heart of the ecosystem. It's used for staking, making payments for AI services, and governing the future of the network.
-   **The Compute Layer (The Engine):** This is a global, decentralized network of `exo` nodes—individual computers run by our community members. This network provides the raw power to run AI models, creating a resilient and distributed alternative to centralized data centers.
-   **The Application Layer (The Tools):** Real-world applications that run on our network, starting with our flagship product, the **"Roxonn Code" VSCode Extension**, which provides powerful AI assistance directly to developers.

## 3. The "Compute Stake Offering" (CSO): Two Ways to Own the Future of AI

Roxonn offers two clear paths for anyone to become an owner in the decentralized AI revolution. You don't need to be a corporation to have a stake in the infrastructure of tomorrow.

### Path 1: Become a Provider (Active Participation)

-   **Who it's for:** Anyone with a capable computer (e.g., a gaming PC, a powerful workstation).
-   **How it works:** Download the `exo` framework, run a node, and contribute your computer's idle processing power to the network. You'll earn `ROXN` tokens for every AI task your node processes.
-   **The Benefit:** Generate active, direct earnings by becoming a foundational part of the AI infrastructure. Your hardware is now an asset that works for you.

### Path 2: Become a Staker (Passive Participation)

-   **Who it's for:** Anyone who believes in the future of decentralized AI, regardless of their hardware.
-   **How it works:** Use the Roxonn platform and our integrated Onramp.money gateway to easily purchase and stake `ROXN` tokens in our **Compute Staking Pool**. Your stake provides liquidity and stability, underwriting the network's capacity and reliability.
-   **The Benefit:** Earn passive rewards from a share of all network fees. You are investing directly in the growth and success of the AI engine itself, without needing to manage any hardware.

## 4. The "Ignition" Event: The Public Launch

The "Ignition" is Roxonn's "Singularity" moment. It marks the transition from our initial phase to a fully public, self-sustaining network. Once the combined total of active `exo` nodes and the amount of `ROXN` in the Compute Staking Pool reaches a critical milestone, the network's full capabilities will be unlocked, introducing more powerful models and enhanced rewards for all participants.

## 5. The Value Loop: How Everyone Wins

Our ecosystem is designed as a self-reinforcing value loop that benefits all participants:

1.  **Demand:** Developers use the "Roxonn Code" extension (and other future tools), paying for AI tasks with `ROXN` tokens.
2.  **Distribution:** These fees are automatically and transparently distributed via smart contract:
    -   A majority share goes to the **Node Provider** who processed the task.
    -   A significant share goes to the **Stakers** who provided the network's financial stability.
    -   A small portion goes to the **Roxonn DAO** to fund future development and ecosystem growth.
3.  **Growth:** This constant demand for `ROXN` drives its value, which in turn increases the rewards for Providers and Stakers, encouraging more participants to join the network and creating a powerful, virtuous cycle.

**Roxonn is more than just an AI tool—it's the infrastructure layer for the next generation of open, decentralized artificial intelligence. Join us and own the engine.**
